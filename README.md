This project aims to construct an *open-source, large-scale, and multi-round* dialogue data powered by Turbo APIs to facilitate the construction of powerful language models with general conversational capability.
In consideration of factors such as safeguarding privacy, **we do not directly use any data available on the Internet as prompts**.
Queries (the User) and responses (the AI) in the dialogue are all generated by separate ChatGPT Turbo APIs and post-processed by human beings.
<img align="bottom" src="https://i.328888.xyz/2023/03/31/iwIdSt.png" width="80px"> is composed of three sectors:

- üåè **Questions about the World**: The dialogue data in this sector is derived from a wide range of inquiries related to concepts, entities, and objects from the real world. The topics covered are extensive, spanning areas such as technology, art, and entrepreneurship.
- ‚úçüèª **Writing and Creation**: The dialogue data in this sector is driven by the demands for writing/creation from scratch, and encompasses any tasks that an AI assistant may aid with in the creative process, spanning from email composition to crafting narratives and plays, and beyond.
- üìã **Assistance on Existent Materials**: The dialogue data in this sector is generated based on existing materials, including but not limited to rewriting, continuation, summarization, and inference, covering a diverse range of topics.


Currently, we have released the first part of the Questions about the World sector, which contains 160k diverse and informative dialogues about the real world. Other data will be released in the future.

## Construction of UltraChat

The general idea of UltraChat is two use separate LLMs to generate opening lines, simulate users and response.
Each sector of UltraChat has its own challenges and requires particular stragety designs. We will specify the construction process once a part of UltraChat is released.
